Welcome to the Paperplane Project documentations!
Here you will find more about Paperplane, including how to set it up!

# What is it?

Paperplane is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python3, which can be coupled up with Mongo DB and a Redis backend.

Originally created by baalajimaestro, Paperplane is currently maintained by zakaryan2004. It has started as a simple userbot, which helped with group management, with lots of features from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), but has since evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.

# Running Paperplane

Before starting, you should read the [Before Starting](/paperplane/before-starting.md) page to make sure you have everything necessary for setting up Paperplane.

After finishing that, you can choose to either install Paperplane using the automatic way(Deploy to Heroku), or manually(for running locally or on a VPS, or if you like doing things the good way).

To get started with the Automatic Way, head to the [The Automatic Way](/paperplane/the-automatic-way.md) page. Remember, this method will only work if you want to deploy to Heroku, and you will still need to generate your string session manually with the Python script (meaning that you need a machine with Python installed).

If you don't want to deploy to Heroku, or you just want to do things the manual way, you can use [The Manual Way](/paperplane/the-manual-way.md) guide and setup Paperplane easily. This way you can run it essentially anywhere which supports Docker.
