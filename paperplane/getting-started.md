### What is it?

Paperplane is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python3, which can be coupled up with Mongo DB and a Redis backend.

Originally created by baalajimaestro, Paperplane is currently maintained by zakaryan2004. It has started as a simple userbot, which helped with group management, with lots of features from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), but has since evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.
