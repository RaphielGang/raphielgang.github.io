### What's this?

A modular Telegram Userbot running on python3 with an MongoDB and Redis Backend.

Started up as a simple bot, which helps with deleting messages and other stuffs when I didn't possess a smartphone (selecting each message indeed difficult) with a ton of meme features kanged from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.
